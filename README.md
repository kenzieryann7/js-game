# A Game Using JavaScript

This is an incremental text-based RPG.

Goals:

* Base could be changed to "Character" or something. Idea being you can upgrade your character stats. Maybe set a timer when you earn a skill point so its easy. Later on, I would like to add where you can equip different armor and add icons, such as creating my own icons making this game more visually attractive and fun.

* Harvesting is where you can basically harvest many materials to aid in your game. For now we can stick with simple harvesting such as mining and harvesting plants. I would like to add more crafting later to really allow the user to be immersed with RPG style gaming. 
  - Mining: mine for materials such as copper, iron, etc. to make armor and weapons.
  - Harvesting: harvest plants for potions. Such as health or mana potions. Or poisons and stat-increasing elixirs.
  - Cooking: cook meals to gain stat increases and to replenish health or mana. 
  
* Attack should allow the user to raid dungeons through a progress bar with the user having access to buttons to heal and make decisions on what they would like to attack. Sort of like a create your own adventure in this mode.
