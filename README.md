# Incremental Game Using JavaScript

This is an incremental text-based RPG.

Goals:

* Base could be changed to "Character" or something. Idea being you can upgrade your character stats. Maybe set a timer when you earn a skill point so its easy. Later on, I would like to add where you can equip different armor and add icons, such as creating my own icons making this game more visually attractive and fun.

* Crafting is where you can basically harvest many materials to aid in your game. For now we can stick with simple harvesting such as mining and harvesting plants. I would like to add more crafting later to really allow the user to be immersed with RPG style gaming. 
  1. Mining: mine for materials such as copper, iron, etc. to make armor and weapons. 
      * For now just mine for material with no uses just to get the functionality.
      * Then come back and add to make certain armors and weapons.
  2. Harvesting: harvest plants for potions. Such as health or mana potions. Or poisons and stat-increasing elixirs.
      * For now just make health and mana potions and store them somewhere.
      * Then figure out how to allow the user to use them in combat and such.
  3. Cooking: cook meals to gain stat increases and to replenish health or mana.
      * This can be worked on after mining and harvesting is put together.
  
* Attack should allow the user to raid dungeons through a progress bar with the user having access to buttons to heal and make decisions on what they would like to attack. Sort of like a create your own adventure in this mode. 

Issues:

* Having trouble using JavaScript with the bootstrap navs to have local content so I do not need to make separate html pages for the crafting (mining, harvesting, and cooking).

Eventually this game will be available on Kongregate and hopefully Steam.
